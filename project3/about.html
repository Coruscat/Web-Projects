    <h1>Duck Dash</h1>
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>A endless runner featuring quick reflexy arcadey swaying left right and center staying the right lane to survive!</p>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Endless Runner, Arcade?</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop-only</p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>I want to make this one a little abstract, you are a duck! They're easy to draw and cute... but more importantly you need to survive the onslaught of bread being thrown at you from off screen and stay on-screen!</p>
    <h2>Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>I plan to utilize hand drawn/pixel-art graphics in my game aiming for more of a sketchy and crude style</p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>Players can move between the lanes, or left or right<br>Players can also choose to eat an oncoming piece of bread every now and then</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>WASD to move (only A and D will move during gameplay)<br>
    Space to eat bread</p>
    <h3>On boarding</h3>
    <p>Controls on main menu</p>
    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>The player will need good hand-eye coordination and learn the timing of the rapidly speeding up bread and when to eat and not</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Jonathan Luke a second year Game Design and Development major at RIT and you can find more about me below</p> <a href="/project1/index.html">At this page!</a>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>The process for my project was to mostly use the basic example used in the circle-blast HW assignment and reverse engineer it into doing what I wanted, which ended up becoming more and more of me doing my own thing pretty differently besides mb some functions like animate or spritesheets and collision.<br>
    In terms of meeting the requirements: There are no errors and I used PIXI, the game is easy to play and takes little explaining, and is pretty robust!<br>
    I worked a lot on the design, there is some sound to give feedback and I've created all my own assets!<br>
    There are no CSS or HTML5 errors that appear when I check! My code is well commented and not written efficiently and fit code conventions<br>
