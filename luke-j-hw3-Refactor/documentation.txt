I've retooled my project 2 just with bulma, everything is still ES6 and I've just cleaned it up and anded the bulma for now.
I added extra html and click events for the bulma elements that are dynamically created by the code
I've used babel and made the file into ES5 and it definetly does not look pretty but it does work.
